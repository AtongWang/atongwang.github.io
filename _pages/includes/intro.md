I am currently an Assistant Researcher in Computer Science, specializing in **artificial intelligence (AI) testing technology**. After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Information and Computational Science from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) in June 2019, I began my Master's studies in Computer Software and Theory at the Academy of Military Sciences in September 2019. I transitioned to a doctoral program in April 2021 in the same field. My research primarily focuses on:

- The safety testing of autonomous driving systems
- Adversarial example research
- Large Language Model (LLM) applications

These efforts aim to enhance the reliability and security of AI applications in critical areas.
